### What is Node.js?

Node.js is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine.
Node.js uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model that makes it lightweight and efficient.


### How was Node.js created?

The creator of Node.js, Ryan Dahl, took the V8 engine from Chrome and embedded it with C++, 
allowing JavaScript to run outside of the browser.

This enables JavaScript to perform lower-level tasks like file handling, similar to languages such as C++.
